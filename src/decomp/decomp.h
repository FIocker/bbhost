// The game's functions as our source (docs/decomp.md): a decompiled
// function takes the game's place at its entry. The whole instructions there
// become a jump to ours, and a trampoline - those instructions, re-aimed to
// run from there (decomp/insn.h), then a jump back - keeps the game's own
// version callable, for a compare run and for ours to lean on. Every
// function is registered here: one list, switched off by name, reported at
// exit.
//
// Each area of the engine keeps its functions in a folder, decomp/<area>/,
// and adds them with decomp_add() from its decomp_<name>_add(), which
// decomp/areas.cpp calls before decomp_install() runs (hle/runtime.cpp).
