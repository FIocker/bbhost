// The eboot's own memcpy (docs/decomp.md): sub_2a1a1b0 at Binary Ninja
// 0x2a1a1b0, 1,440 call sites - GX's resource creators copying a new
// buffer's or texture's initial data in (sub_256d420 at 0x256d5ea,
// sub_2571d60), the work items of the engine's parallel copy of a streamed
// file (sub_23bde30, which the main loop waits for in sub_2157c70), and the
// struct and string copies of everything else.
//
// Ours copies with the host's memmove, and a copy of kReleaseBytes or more
// first releases the destination's write-watched pages in one call
// (core/write_watch.h): memory a dead resource's surface or a buffer-shadow
// page still watched faulted once per 4 KiB page under the game's copy - on
// the main loop's thread, or on the pool workers it was waiting for. In a
// Central Yharnam warp tour, after a fault learned to release the pages
// ahead of a streaming writer, texture creation's copies were still 4,843
// of the last 16,384 faults: too short for a run to build up. The copy
// writes the whole range, so a release before it is what its faults would
// have done, a page at a time.
//
// The game's version does not return the destination (its small-size path
// leaves a jump-table address in rax), so no caller reads the result; where
// source and destination overlap it copies forward in blocks, memmove
// exactly. There is no compare run: a copy is checked by what it copies.
