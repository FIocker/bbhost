// The engine's parallel copy of a resource's file data (docs/decomp.md):
// sub_23bde30 at Binary Ninja 0x23bde30. Its one caller, sub_2157f40 (the
// job a streamed GX resource is built in), hands it the data the file
// repository loaded and a buffer from the graphics heap; it splits the copy
// into page-aligned pieces for the CSEzWorkPool workers and returns a work
// group, and sub_2157c70 - on the main loop's thread, in
// SprjFileStep::STEP_Update - waits for that group before it queues the job
// itself. On the PS4 the destination is write-combined memory a core writes
// slowly, which is what the spread is for; here it is ordinary memory, and
// the wait was the pool's round trip: the main loop's longest waits while
// the world streams (7-27 ms each, ~160 ms a Central Yharnam warp tour with
// the write-watch faults already gone, ~800-1,000 ms before).
//
// Ours copies at once on the calling thread - the destination's watched
// pages released first, as decomp/memory/game_memcpy.cpp does - and hands back no
// group, which the caller already takes for "nothing to wait for": the job
// is queued as before, its data in place.
