// The STUN Binding exchange, as bytes: a request the host sends
// from its P2P UDP socket to the private server's STUN listener (or any
// public STUN server), and the response that carries the address and port
// the world sees that socket at - the reflexive address the server records
// for other players to reach us behind NAT. No sockets here; hle/net.cpp
// sends and receives on the P2P port so the mapping is that port's.
//
// The request is RFC 5389's shape (the magic cookie leads the transaction
// id), which an RFC 3489 server such as the private server's reads as a
// 16-byte id. The response is taken from MAPPED-ADDRESS (0x0001)
// when present, else XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS (0x8020 or 0x0020), un-XORed with
// the cookie when the response carries it and with the transaction id's
// own first bytes otherwise (what the private server's does).
