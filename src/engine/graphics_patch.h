// The post-processing switches, as byte patches on the eboot.
//
// Three sessions went into looking for these in data - the YEBIS debug block
// (a mirror the renderer ignores), Yebis2ParamFile.filterparam (never opened)
// and GPARAM (loaded, edited, ignored). They are not data at all: they are a
// constructor's immediate and a branch.
//
//   mov dword [rbx+0x2968], 0x01010101
//
// is one instruction writing four adjacent bools - SSAO, motion blur,
// anti-alias and a fourth - so each is a byte of that immediate, and zeroing
// one turns the effect off at construction. Depth of field is a branch
// instead: `cmp dword [rbx+0x1ac], 0; je +0xde` around its setup, forced.
//
// The addresses come from the shadPS4 community patch list for 1.09 and were
// checked against the eboot before being used: the flag site really does hold
// `01 01 01 01` and the DoF site really is that `je`. Every patch is gated on
// the eboot's SHA-256 and refuses on an unexpected byte, like the rest.
//
// Motion blur is the exception: its bool is left alone, because clearing it
// blows the frame out here, and the blur shader is neutralised instead
// (host/shader_patch.h).
//
// All five follow their settings live now (graphics_patch.cpp, "Live"): the
// bools are written on every renderer as it draws a view, chromatic
// aberration's 1.0 is rewritten in place, and motion blur and depth of field
// are shader patches. The render resolution changes live too
// (engine/live_resolution.h).
