// Event flags: the world's state as numbered
// bits - bosses killed, doors opened, NPC steps, and the online state the
// event scripts read (2000-2022, written from the session each frame) - kept
// by SprjEventFlagMan (the singleton slot at Binary Ninja 0x593b100). The
// host's reader and writer for plugins, over the store's layout as
// decomp/events/flag_store.h writes it down (the game's own four flag
// functions are ours there), read without trusting the game's memory: a
// plugin may ask before the store exists. The first read on the main thread
// is checked against the game's own getter (a line either way).
//
// Changes: while watching (a plugin's on_event_flag, or
// BBHOST_EVENT_FLAG_LOG=1 to log each), every flag a setter flips is taken
// from decomp's ring once a frame, on the main thread.
