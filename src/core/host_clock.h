// Clocks. The guest reads time through gettimeofday, sceKernelGetProcessTime,
// sceKernelReadTsc, sceKernelClockGettime, time and clock - the main loop,
// its job threads and the frame limiter, many times a frame. On Windows
// those went through std::chrono (libstdc++) into winpthreads' clock_gettime,
// which asks QueryPerformanceFrequency and divides on every call, behind the
// FS- and stack-switching thunk. These read the counter once and scale it
// with a multiply set up at start, and the HLE entries that use them are
// bound raw (no thunk): they touch no thread-local state.
//
// Timer settings (Windows). The process asks for 1 ms timer resolution at
// start (timeBeginPeriod(1)) - it used to happen at the first host_sleep_us,
// after the window pump had been sleeping 15.6 ms steps - and opts out of
// power throttling: no EcoQoS clock drops for its threads, and Windows 11
// keeps the resolution when the window is hidden or minimized (it otherwise
// lets a hidden window's process fall back to 15.6 ms, which every timed
// wait and Sleep then rounds to). BBHOST_TIMER_PERIOD=0, BBHOST_WIN_QOS=0.
//
// Priorities (Windows). The vblank clock above the rest, the threads that
// feed the GPU (command processors, recorder, submission, presenter) one
// step above normal: on a busy machine a guest worker no longer takes a
// pacing thread's core. BBHOST_THREAD_PRIO=0 leaves every thread normal.
