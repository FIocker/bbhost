// The presenter's one pass over the swapchain image (host/window.cpp). The
// game's display image is drawn into the picture's rectangle - a full-screen
// triangle sampling it, which is what vkCmdBlitImage does with a linear filter
// - and the host overlay (the FPS counter, the pointer, the text box, F10's
// screen) and the plugin menu (F9) go into the same rendering. The bars beside
// a picture of another shape are the rendering's clear.
//
// What it replaces, per presented frame: a transfer-layout change, a clear of
// the whole image when there are bars, the blit, and - with anything on the
// overlay - a second layout change and a second rendering that loaded the
// image the blit had just stored. Now: one layout change in, one rendering,
// one out. A magnified picture (FSR 1, host/fsr.cpp) keeps its compute passes.
