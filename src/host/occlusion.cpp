// Occlusion queries and predication, the way the PS4's depth blocks do them.
//
// The hardware has no begin and end: each depth block (DB, eight on a base
// PS4) counts the samples that pass, and an EVENT_WRITE of ZPASS_DONE /
// PIXEL_PIPE_STAT_DUMP makes every DB store its count, bit 63 set, at the
// dump's address + 16 * db. Gnm's occlusion query is a block of eight
// {begin, end} pairs the game zeroes, dumps into before (+0) and after (+8)
// the draw it measures, and reads back: the sum of end - begin is how many
// samples passed. Bloodborne measures its culling proxies that way (GX
// GetData 0x256a2f0) - each window one draw, about 180 of them a frame in a
// dense view - and YEBIS its luminance. Until now every dump wrote a rising
// fake count (gnm_exec.cpp), so every object the game tested was visible and
// it culled nothing: on the same APU, Kyo measured the game at ~51% GPU with
// real counts against ~89% without, and 90 -> 130 fps uncapped in a heavy
// spot, with 86-88% of the tested objects occluded.
//
// Here (the design is Kyo's KyoPS4x counter, #217-#220, done natively):
// - The counted draws. After a dump the next draws get a Vulkan occlusion
//   query each, begun and ended around the draw on the recorder's thread
//   (DrawCall::query_pool), so a query never spans a render pass. 64 of them
//   after a dump to the first half of a 16-byte cell (a Gnm block's begin;
//   BBHOST_OCCLUSION_CAP), one after any other dump (an end, or a block that
//   is not 16-aligned). A draw past those, or one that reached no query (a
//   draw bbhost did not record, a full pool), is "unmeasured": it adds a
//   large count, so a difference spanning it reads visible, never occluded.
// - The dumps. The command processor records the stream as items - query,
//   unmeasured, dump - and the GPU walks them (shaders/occlusion.comp) once
//   the draws have run: query results are copied with their availability,
//   a running total T is kept the way the DBs keep theirs, and each dump
//   writes T over the eight DBs with the valid bit into guest memory by
//   device address. That happens before the submission's label writes, so
//   the counts are there when the game's end-of-pipe fence says the GPU is
//   done - the PS4's order, with no CPU round trip and nothing predicted.
//   A dump whose interval holds a query that never became available (AMD's
//   driver resolves none while the window is unfocused, Kyo #220) is not
//   written: the block stays as the game zeroed it, not ready, and the game
//   keeps its own previous answer.
// - Precise counts when the device has occlusionQueryPrecise (the game sets
//   PERFECT_ZPASS_COUNTS); without it a nonzero result counts as plainly
//   visible (NVIDIA's unprecise results are 0/1, and one sample read as
//   "culled" was the best explanation of a black world on KyoPS4x, #219).
// - SET_PREDICATION (PM4 0x20) with a ZPASS operation: when every dump into
//   the block has retired, the CPU reads the block and the draws up to the
//   predicate's clear are skipped before any of their work (host_gpu_draw)
//   or drawn; when a dump is still in flight, the items so far are resolved
//   at once (the pass ends) and the shader also writes the predicate, which
//   the draws read through VK_EXT_conditional_rendering. Without the
//   extension, or for an unknown block, they are drawn: a wrong "occluded"
//   makes geometry vanish.
//
// DB_COUNT_CONTROL is not honoured: the context registers are not kept for
// token draws, and counting a draw the game left uncounted only makes a
// result more visible. PIXEL_PIPE_STAT_RESET is ignored, as by KyoPS4x.
//
// BBHOST_OCCLUSION=0: the old fake. BBHOST_PREDICATION=0: SET_PREDICATION
// ignored (every predicated draw drawn). Counts in the 300-flip report and at
// exit ("occlusion:").
