// The PC port's key bindings, the way Dark Souls III PC keeps them: every
// action has a keyboard key **and** a mouse button, either may be unbound, and
// a binding is changed by choosing the action and pressing what it should be.
//
// Actions are named by what they do in Bloodborne rather than by pad button,
// because that is what a player rebinds, and each one sets the pad bit (or
// stick direction) the game reads for it. The order below is the order the
// Key Bindings screen lists them in: pages of seven
// (engine/option_menu.cpp), the last one short.
//
// Sources, weakest first: the defaults here, `bbhost.toml`'s [keys], then the
// [keys] section of `bbhost-options.toml`, which is what the in-game screen
// writes. A value names the whole binding: "E", "Mouse2", "X, Mouse2", or
// "none". Mouse1..Mouse5 are the left, right and middle buttons and the two
// side buttons; WheelUp and WheelDown the wheel, each notch a short press.
