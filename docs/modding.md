# Modding

bbhost never modifies the game files. Every change is layered on top at run
time, from a few places:

| What | Where | Needs code? |
|---|---|---|
| Replacement files (menus, text, textures, layouts) | the mods folder | no |
| Param values (weapons, enemies, item lots, shops) | `<mods>/params/*.toml` | no |
| Byte patches to the game's code | `patches/*.toml` | no |
| Anything else | a plugin ([plugins.md](plugins.md)) | yes |

## The mods folder

`paths.mods` in `bbhost.toml` (default `<data>/mods`) is checked before the
game dump for every file the game opens. A file at
`<mods>/dvdroot_ps4/<path>` replaces the game's `dvdroot_ps4/<path>`. The log
lists the files served from it (`FS overlay: ...`).

Files are matched by their path as the game requests it, so a replacement
keeps the original's name and container format (`.dcx` stays compressed).

## Params

The game's numbers live in 62 param tables: weapons, armour, enemies, attacks,
magic, item lots, shops, special effects, the lock-on camera and more. bbhost
reads the field definitions the game ships (`dvdroot_ps4/paramdef`), so fields
are named the way FromSoftware named them.

Put one TOML file per table in `<mods>/params/<TableName>.toml`:

```toml
# <mods>/params/EquipParamWeapon.toml - the Saw Cleaver is row 1000000
row.1000000.correctStrength = 250
row.1000000.weight = 0.5

# <mods>/params/LockCamParam.toml - every row
row.all.camDistTarget = 5.5
row.all.chrLockRangeMaxRadius = 30

# An array element is row.<id>.<name>[<i>]. Where no name fits, use a raw
# type and byte offset: f32 i32 u32 i16 u16 i8 u8.
row.1000000.f32_0x10 = 1.5
```

Table names are the ones the log prints (`params: slot N <TableName>: <TYPE>,
R rows`). To see a row before changing it:

```sh
BBHOST_PARAM_DUMP="EquipParamWeapon:1000000,LockCamParam:0" ./bbhost
```

This prints every field with its value, type and the game's own description.
Overrides apply whenever a table loads, including when the game reloads one.
A table whose rows do not match its definition is refused with a log line
instead of being written wrongly.

`tools/bbparam.py` reads and searches the param tables of a dump from the
command line (set `BBHOST_APP0` to the game folder).

## Lighting and post-processing

Per-area lighting, fog, tone mapping and post effects are data in
`param/drawparam/*.gparam.dcx`. `tools/gparam.py --list <file>` shows a
file's parameters; `tools/gparam.py --set "Name=value" <dump> <mods>` writes
edited copies of every file into the mods folder.

## Text

Message banks (`msg/<lang>/*.msgbnd.dcx`, FMG files) are read through the mods
folder as well. `src/engine/menu_assets.cpp` shows how bbhost adds its own
entries to the game's banks at start, in every language.

## Patch manifests

A byte patch is a TOML file. bbhost reads every `*.toml` in these folders, a
later file replacing an earlier one with the same name:

1. `<exe dir>/patches` (the release package)
2. `<exe dir>/../patches` (a build tree: `build/bbhost` reads the repository's `patches/`)
3. `<mods>/patches` (a mod's own)

```toml
[patch]
name = "skip-intro"
eboot = "941f887a562aae054fac35af8cc8f27cf075f3d4cc2e029fb5ae2a663aaa5ae7"
description = "the three company logos at startup are skipped"
option = "startup.skip_intro"      # optional: a setting that switches it
enabled = true                      # optional: false makes it off until the player turns it on

[site.logo-fromsoft]
address = "0x04d99138"              # Binary Ninja address (image at 0x400000)
expect = "4c 00 6f 00"              # the bytes that must be there
bytes = "00 00 00 00"               # the bytes written, same length
kind = "code"                       # optional: "code" (default) or "data"
```

- `eboot` is the SHA-256 of the decrypted eboot the addresses belong to. A
  file for another build is skipped.
- Every site's `expect` is checked before anything is written; one mismatch
  refuses the whole file. A site that already holds `bytes` counts as done.
- `kind = "code"` restores the page to read-only and executable afterwards;
  `"data"` leaves it writable.
- `BBHOST_PATCHES=0` skips all manifests. The log has one line per file:
  written, skipped or refused.

The setup window's Patches tab lists every manifest with a switch. A patch
that follows an `option` is switched by that setting; any other by
`<name> = true` or `false` under `[patches]` in `bbhost.toml`, and without one
by its own `enabled` (a workaround only some players need ships with
`enabled = false`; the tab's All on leaves those as they are).

Shipped patches:

| File | Effect |
|---|---|
| `skip-intro.toml` | skips the company logos and the "Exit Game may not have been selected" warning (illusion's 1.09 patch) |
| `fov-uncap.toml` | removes the 38-48 degree limit on the camera's field of view |
| `quick-reentry.toml` | loads after a death or lamp travel end when the area is ready instead of after 12 seconds (on by default) |
| `ingame-post-processors.toml` | three resource post-processors during play instead of two: streaming settles sooner, with more hitches meanwhile (off by default) |
| `deflate-level.toml` | the game's run-time compression at level 1 instead of 9, removing a periodic ~25 ms hitch |
| `old-hunters.toml` | makes the game treat itself as The Old Hunters edition, so the DLC is available (Kyo's 1.09 patch) |
| `debug-camera.toml` | restores the debug free camera (Lance McDonald's 1.09 patch): hold Action and press L3 to cycle its modes. Off by default; it replaces a debug-menu test step, which then must not be used |
| `intel-sfx-workaround.toml` | stops one kind of special effect from being drawn, emoose's 1.09 workaround for a crash reported on Windows with Intel 12th-generation and newer CPUs. Off by default |

Patches whose bytes depend on settings, and anything that needs a hook rather
than fixed bytes, are written in code or as plugins.

## Event scripts and talk scripts

The maps' event scripts (`event/*.emevd.dcx`) and the NPC talk scripts
(`script/talk/*.talkesdbnd.dcx`) can be rewritten at start from the player's
own dump and served through the overlay, so nothing is redistributed. Two of
bbhost's PC enhancements work this way and serve as examples:

- `src/engine/maiden_events.cpp` rewrites the invasion events so the late
  areas take two invaders (the five-player sessions).
- `src/engine/rebirth.cpp` adds "Rebirth in the Nightmare" to the Altar of
  Despair's talk script and drives the level-up screen from it.

## Tools

The `tools/` folder has small, independent scripts for the game's formats:
`bbparam.py` (params), `gparam.py` (draw params), `msb.py` (map layouts),
`luabnd.py` (AI script bundles), `shaderbnd.py` (shader bundles) and
`gfx_dump.py` (Scaleform menus). Each documents its options at the top of
the file. Scripts that read the game need `BBHOST_APP0` set to the folder
that contains `dvdroot_ps4`.
